# Superfluidity Information Model
The SIM (Superfluidity Information Model) model takes the concepts from the three other models (RDCL3D, CRAN deployment, Landscaper suite) - you can see this by hovering over the concepts in SIM to see where the concept came from.

The SIM is generated in OWL-RDF, which is a description language for capturing information about a domain, including the entities and relationships.

To be able to modify the OWL files that are captured you will need a utility called Protégé. This is available from Stanford and is the standard knowledge representation system for ontologies. Protégé is available for all standard platforms - from https://protege.stanford.edu/. There are many guides for running and using this software. The two guides that are used most often are the wiki page link - https://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Protege4Pizzas10Minutes
And the older Pizza building PDF document - http://mowl-power.cs.man.ac.uk/protegeowltutorial/resources/ProtegeOWLTutorialP4_v1_3.pdf

Please note that unlike a graph based layout a knowledge representation system doesn't have to have a single common ancestor. Multiple relationships between different classes are allowed. All concepts must be explicitly defined otherwise they are assumed not to exist.
